PLMan is a system for managing peer instances across a PlanetLab-like set of
servers. It automatically copies the peer code to each of the servers it is
given, and starts it. These peers connect to a central server, which allows
clients to connect to it and start/stop/kill peer instances from a simple
interface. The protocol is simple enough it can be managed from a bare netcat
session.

An implementation of Chord is provided as an example application.
